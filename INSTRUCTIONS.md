SUMMARY

Create a Flutter application which gives the user the ability to save their
favorite coffee pictures. This project is intentionally open-ended and we want
you to be creative and treat this as you would a normal client who has come
seeking your expertise. Feel free to use any third party packages as needed.
Please ensure that the project meets all requirements outlined in this document
to the best of your ability.

This project should take no more than a day to complete, but you have up to 7
days to send us back the results. All code should be managed in a public Github
repository. To submit the finished product, email us the repository.

User Requirements

As a user, I should be able to:

- Open the app and load a new coffee image from the network
- Load a new coffee image if the current one is not my favorite
- Save the current coffee image locally if I really like it, so I can access my
  favorite coffee images at any time, even if I don’t have internet access ○
  Make sure any loading/error states are handled correctly

Technical Requirements

- The application should pull the coffee images from the free API
  https://coffee.alexflipnote.dev
- There should be clear instructions for how to run the application in the
  README.md
- The application should run on iOS and Android (no need to include Web/Desktop)

Coding Values

At Very Good Ventures, we value code that is:

- Robust
- Well tested
- Easy to understand
- Has a clear and consistent architecture

As such, we recommend you to write unit/widget tests, have a clear separation of
concerns between different components (for example, don’t mix UI and data
acquisition), and consider that your code will be read by other developers, so
the easier you can make it for them, the better! You can take inspiration from
some of this projects:

- The tutorials on Flutter Bloc: https://bloclibrary.dev/
- I/O Pinball: https://github.com/flutter/pinball
- I/O Photobooth: https://github.com/photobooth Has a clear and consistent
  architecture
